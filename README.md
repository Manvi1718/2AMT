# 2 A.M. THOUGHTS

"2 A.M. Thoughts" is a web project designed to address the curiosity, doubts, and mental health concerns of young minds and adolescents. This platform aims to provide a safe space where individuals can open their hearts and share their thoughts with others. It features a blogging system UI/UX design created using HTML and CSS.
